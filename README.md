# Database design for football league


#### Project Overview
The ``Bangladesh Football League database`` project was created with a view of effectively managing and automating a football league's record-keeping. ``Teams, Players, Matches, Goals, and Results`` are the five separate tables that include the data for the ``four teams``. Every table has several columns designed to meet particular data needs. Goals and results are automatically updated in the database according to the status of the match, which can be ``Scheduled``, ``In Progress``, or ``Finished``. When a match is finished, the Results table is updated with the new scores and goals. The shift from ``In Progress`` to ``Finished`` denotes the start of a match. Triggers that are dependent on changes in the match status make this automation easier. <br>

This project gives a excellent idea to design a database for the teams. This knowledge and idea could be use in different purpose in future.
